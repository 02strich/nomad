# Clustering

We have started our first agent and run a job against it in development mode.
This demonstrates the ease of use and the workflow of Nomad, but did not show how
this could be extended to a scalable, production-grade configuration. In this step,
we will create our first real cluster with multiple nodes.

## Starting the Server

## Starting the Clients

## Submit a Job

## Next Steps

We've now concluded the getting started guide, however there are a number
of [next steps](next-steps.html) to get started with Nomad.
