# Jobs

Jobs are the primary configuration that users interact with when using
Nomad. A job is a declaritive specification of tasks that Nomad should run.
Jobs have a globally unique name, one or many task groups, which are themselves
collections of one or many tasks.

The format of the jobs is [documented here](/docs/jobspec/index.html). They
can either be specified in [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) or JSON,
however we recommend only using JSON when the configuration is generated by a machine.

To get started, we will use the [`init` command](/docs/commands/init.html) which
generates an skeleton job file:

```
$ nomad init
Created job file 'example.nomad'

$ cat example.nomad

job "example" {
    region = "global"
    datacenter = ["dc1", "dc2"]
    ...
}

```

## Next Steps

We've now covered the basic workflow around jobs with Nomad. Next
we will do a brief [tour of the HTTP API](http.html).
