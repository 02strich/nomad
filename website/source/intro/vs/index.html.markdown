# Nomad vs. Other Software

There are a number of other options in the market currently that claim
to store secrets in some capacity. This section compares Nomad to these
other software choices.

Due to the bias of the comparisons being on the Nomad website, we attempt
to only use facts. If you find something that is invalid or out of date
in the comparisons, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues) and we'll
address it as soon as possible.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Nomad versus other
systems.
