# Command: job eval

The `job eval` command is used to force an evaluation of a job, given the job ID.

## Usage

```
nomad job eval [options] <job_id>
```

The `job eval` command requires a single argument, specifying the job ID to evaluate.
If there is an exact match based on the provided job ID, then
the job will be evaluated, forcing a scheduler run.

## General Options

<%= partial "docs/commands/_general_options" %>

## Eval Options

* `-force-reschedule`: `force-reschedule` is used to force placement of failed allocations.
If this is set, failed allocations that are past their reschedule limit, and those that are
scheduled to be replaced at a future time are placed immediately. This option only places failed
allocations if the task group has rescheduling enabled.

## Examples

Evaluate the job with ID "job1":

```
$ nomad job eval job1
Created eval ID: "6754c2e3-9abb-e7e9-dc92-76aab01751c8"
```

Evaluate the job with ID "job1", and reschedule any eligible failed allocations:

```
$ nomad job eval -force-reschedule job1
Created eval ID: "6754c2e3-9abb-e7e9-dc92-76aab01751c8"
```
