# Command: init

The `init` command creates a [jobspec](/docs/jobspec/) template in the current
directory that demonstrates some common configurations for tasks, tasks groups,
runtime constraints, and resource allocation.

Please refer to the [jobspec](/docs/jobspec/) and [drivers](/docs/drivers/)
pages to learn how to customize the template.

## Usage

```
nomad init
```
