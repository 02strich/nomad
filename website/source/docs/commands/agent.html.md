# Nomad Agent

The agent command is the heart of Nomad: it runs the agent that handles client
or server functionality, including exposing interfaces for client consumption
and running jobs.

Due to the power and flexibility of this command, the Nomad agent is documented
in its own section. See the [Nomad Agent](/docs/agent/index.html) section for
more information on how to use this command and the options it has.
