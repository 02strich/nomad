# Command: client-servers

The `client-servers` command is used to query or list the known servers of
an agent in client mode. Clients do not participate in the gossip protocol
and instead register themselves with these server nodes directly over TCP.
This command can be used to keep this server configuration up to date on
client nodes.

## Usage

```
nomad client-servers [options] [<address>...]
```

There are two modes of operation for the `client-servers` command. If no
arguments are given, then list mode is invoked, which queries the agent
for its known list of servers, and dumps this information to the screen.

If the `-update` flag is given along with some server addresses, then the
command will update the agent's server list configuration with these new
addresses. It is important to note that during updates, the server list
is completely replaced with the given servers. This means you must pass
in all server addresses required during updates.

## General Options
